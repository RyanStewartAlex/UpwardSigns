# UpwardSigns

Description: Minecraft plugin that uses signs with the text "[Up]" on the first line. If the signs are clicked, it teleports the player to the next open space up from where they were standing.

#What It's Used For

It can be used for an elevator system, a ladder system, or a generic transportation system.


#Why It's Better to Other Similar Plugins or Ladders

My plugin uses sound effects and text messages to make transport more fun. It's almost like the scripted version of a trap-door ladder.  it also has permission nodes to create and use the signs.


#Permissions

1.upwardsigns.create
..*Allows the use to create the sign using "[Up]". If a player tries to make an UpwardSigns sign without the permission, it doesn't allow for it to be active and does not return an error message.
1.*upwardsigns.use 
..*Allows for users to use UpwardSigns signs.
